# WeeklyWorkouts-Android-App
A big personal project, my first big Android Application

Made during Summer of 2017. I spent about 1 months on this project, off and on. This is my first large app so I didn't structure it and planned it through my head. I started a second version of this app to fix the mess of code but got bored since making the same thing over again wasn't very fun. This app was tested using a Nexus 6p and wasn't optomized for small screens and tablets.

Technology Used:
Web Crawling (Web Crawled over 1000 exercises)
Simple Data Structures
Poorly Executed Object Oriented Programming
Other stuff

Instructions:
This application has two sections, "Weekly Workouts" and "Encyclopedia".

# Weekly Workouts
In this section you can build workouts for a muscle group. For example, I want to create a exercise for Quads (Legs). I will create a new workout section called Quads. Then in that section I will create individual exercises and set the number of sets and reps of that exercise I want to do. After I save, that exercise will be added.
After I complete that exercise I will long press that exercise and then "Change Status" from "Planned" to "Done". If I choose not to do that exercise I would hit "Refuse". Depending on my choice my workout completion will change accordingly.
This app is called weekly workouts because the initial plan was to have the user create a full workout will all the muscle groups they want to workout per week. Then as the week progresses they can track what they have worked out already, what day of the weekly cycle they are in, exercises left, and exercises completed.

# Encyclopeida
There is a lot of workout content in this app stored in the backend (somewhere around 1000 exercises). To browse all these workouts and learn new workouts I created this encyclopedia of all muscle groups. Clicking on an exercise will bring the user to a webpage on the ExRx.net which will visually and literally describe the exercise.
